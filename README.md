AutoItDict2
===========

An implementation of a dictionary type for AutoIt.

Reasons
=======
Created for the following reasons..

* Wanted to get a basic understanding of AutoItObject.
* Wanted to get a basic understanding of the Micro unit test framework.
* AutoIt has no native dict or associative array type.
* It's laborious to use `Scripting.dictionary` all the time.
